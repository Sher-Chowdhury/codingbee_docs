# pods

So far we've done a quick hello world example. However the pod object definitions can have other features, that are quite similar to docker/docker-compose. 

## Volumes

There are different types of storage [Kubernetes volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes) that you can attach to the containers inside your pods. 

### hostPath volumes

hostPath volumes are not often used, but is a good example for learning purposes. hostPath let's you share a worker node's directory with a container inside a pod. 

To try this, we first need to create a folder and put some content in it. We have to do this on the worker node. In our case our worker node is a minikube vm, so we ssh into it like this:

```bash
minikube ssh
```

In our example, we'll create the following folder and content:

```bash
sudo su -
mkdir /tmp/webcontent
echo 'hostPath example' > /tmp/webcontent/index.html
```

Then back on our macbook we apply and test:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f configs/hostPath-example/pod-object-definition.yml 
pod "pod-httpd" created
$ curl http://192.168.99.100:31000
hostPath example
```

You can now ssh into your minikube vm, and dynamically update your content and see it get updated accordingly:

```bash
$ minikube ssh
                         _             _
            _         _ ( )           ( )
  ___ ___  (_)  ___  (_)| |/')  _   _ | |_      __  
/' _ ` _ `\| |/' _ `\| || , <  ( ) ( )| '_`\  /'__`\
| ( ) ( ) || || ( ) || || |\`\ | (_) || |_) )(  ___/
(_) (_) (_)(_)(_) (_)(_)(_) (_)`\___/'(_,__/'`\____)

$ sudo su -
# curl http://localhost:31000
hostPath example
# echo 'goodbye' > /tmp/webcontent/index.html
# curl http://localhost:31000
goodbye
#
```



## Command

In your pod definitions you can specify a particular command to run. Here's an example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-httpd
  labels:
    component: apache_webserver
spec: 
  volumes: 
    - name: webcontent    #Â here we specify the name of the volume
      emptyDir: {}        # the '{}' is yaml syntax to represent an empty dictionary
  containers:
    - name: cntr-httpd
      image: httpd
      volumeMounts:
        - name: webcontent
          mountPath: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
    - name: cntr-centos
      image: centos
      volumeMounts:
        - name: webcontent
          mountPath: /tmp/reports
      command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
      args:
        - while true ; do
            echo "this content is being generated by the centos container" >> /tmp/reports/index.html ;
            date >> /tmp/reports/index.html ;
            sleep 5 ;
          done
        # this args gets parsed as a single line, so have to end relevant line with a ';'
```

In this example, we will actually build a 2-container pod. These pods are sharing a storage volume (which we called webcontent). This volumen is of the type 'emptyDir', which in kubernetes world, is ephemeral storage (it get's deleted when the pod is deleted). cntr-centos is running a custom command, which is effectively updating the index.html file that's being used by the other container. Since it's now a 2-container pod, you have to wait a few seconds longer for the pod to become ready:


```bash
$ kubectl apply -f configs/command-example/pod-object-definition.yml
pod "pod-httpd" created

$ kubectl get pods
NAME        READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
pod-httpd   0/2       ContainerCreating   0          3s
$ kubectl get pods
NAME        READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
pod-httpd   0/2       ContainerCreating   0          8s
$ kubectl get pods
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod-httpd   2/2       Running   0          29s


$ curl http://192.168.99.100:31000
this content is being generated by the centos container
Fri Feb 22 11:24:49 UTC 2019
this content is being generated by the centos container
Fri Feb 22 11:24:54 UTC 2019
this content is being generated by the centos container
Fri Feb 22 11:24:59 UTC 2019
this content is being generated by the centos container
Fri Feb 22 11:25:04 UTC 2019
this content is being generated by the centos container
Fri Feb 22 11:25:09 UTC 2019

```

One thing to note, is that the command you specify needs to be a long running command. Otherwise  the container will keep shutting down inside the pod, and kubernetes will then think the container has failed will keep restarting that container again.

A possible use case for using emptyDir type of volume is where you have a primary container whose logs you want to keep track of in which case, you would have a secondary log forwarding container, e.g. a filebeat container, and you share the //var/log contents from the primary container with the filebeat container.
