# Persistant Volumes

Persistant volumes are volumes that stores a container's data outside of a pod. So that when a pod dies, then the data still persists and get's used by a replacement container. hostpath volumes is an example of a persistant volume. However it has some limitations, in that:

- hostPath volumes are only accessible by pods that are on the same worker node. 
- If worker nodes gets terminated then all hostPath volumes gets deleted. 


 There are lots of other [Persistant Volume Plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes) available, some of which are cloud platform specific. There are 2 ways to create persistant volumes:

 - statically 
 - dynamically (by using persistantVolumeClaims)
 
  Let's take a look at both these approaches using AWS's AWSElasticBlockStore as an example.


## Statically Provisioned Persistant Volumes

In this approach we manually create an EBS volume:

```bash
aws ec2 create-volume --availability-zone=eu-west-1a --size=10 --volume-type=gp2
```

This volume needs to be in the same AWS AZ as the worker node that it will be attached to. Then you use the ebs volume like this:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-httpd
  labels:
    component: apache_webserver
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: webcontent
      awsElasticBlockStore:
        volumeID: <volume-id>             # need to hardcode the volume id in. 
        fsType: ext4
  containers:
    - name: cntr-httpd
      image: httpd
      volumeMounts:
        - name: webcontent
          mountPath: /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This approach has a few pros and cons, depending on individual's permissions/roles/responsibilities in a workplace. For example a pod creator may need to seek company approval to get an EBS block created (since they cost money). Once their request is approved, the request could then be passed on to an AWS administrator to be actioned. The AWS administrator would then inform the pod creator of the volume id to use. 

However in other workplaces, the pod ceator may have full rights+approvals to create EBS volumes. In which case, manually creating ebs then copy+pasting volume id into the yaml file is not an elegant solution. Instead it may be better to dynamically provision it. 



## Dynamically Provision Persistant Volumes

In this approach, you can get kubernetes to create an EBS volume for you on-demand, i.e. [dynamic provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/). This involves creating 3 types of Kubernetes objects:

- [StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) object
- [Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) object
- Persistant Volume object


Here's the steps involved:

1. pod object - Your pod definition defines a volume it wishes to mount. The volume is referenced with a PVC.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-mysql-db
  labels:
    component: mysql_db
spec: 
  volumes: 
    - name: db-data-storage 
      persistentVolumeClaim:       
        claimName: pvc-mysql-db   # here we specify which PVC should request for this pod's PV
  containers:
    - name: cntr-mysql-db
      image: mysql
      env:
        - name: "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"
          value: "password123"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: db-data-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
      ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
```

2. PVC object - Sends a request to the StorageClass object for a new PV. This essentially means that a PVC is a controller object. The PVC references the storage class. 

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-mysql-db
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce   # this means that corresponding PV can only be used by a single node. Also see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Mi
      storageClassName: standard  # This specifies which the StorageClass's name. It defaults to 'standard' if you omit this line
```

3. StorageClass - This in effect is a controller object. This creates the EBS volume as per the PVC's request, and publishes in the form of a persistent volume. 

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
  creationTimestamp: "2019-03-14T19:50:50Z"
  labels:
    addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: EnsureExists
  name: standard
  resourceVersion: "345"
  selfLink: /apis/storage.k8s.io/v1/storageclasses/standard
  uid: 77e456f6-4692-11e9-b5c9-08002722e1d0
provisioner: k8s.io/minikube-hostpath
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

The 'standard' storageClass object actually comes included with a kubernetes installation. 

```bash
$ kubectl get storageclass
NAME                 TYPE
standard (default)   k8s.io/minikube-hostpath   


$ kubectl describe storageclass standard
Name:           standard
IsDefaultClass: Yes
Annotations:    storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true
Provisioner:    k8s.io/minikube-hostpath
Parameters:     <none>
Events:         <none>
```

The Kubernetes install is smart enough to know which platform it is running on and will create a default 'standard' StorageClass object that's native to that platform. In our case our platform is minikube, so the storageclass.provisioner is minikube-hostpath shown above. We managed to get the above yaml content by running `kubectl edit storageclasses standard`.


When we apply the above yamls, we get:

```bash
$ kubectl get pvc
NAME           STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
pvc-mysql-db   Bound    pvc-c160899f-4739-11e9-b5c9-08002722e1d0   100Mi      RWO            standard       16m
```

As mentioned earlier, pvc objects are controller objects, so the underying pv has also been created:

```bash
$ kubectl get pv -o wide
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                  STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE
pvc-c160899f-4739-11e9-b5c9-08002722e1d0   100Mi      RWO            Delete           Bound    default/pvc-mysql-db   standard                16m
```

This PV is then attached to the pod:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

## Testing our Persistant Volume. 

On the surface it looks like our mysql data will now be persistant. Let's now try to test this. We'll test this by creating a mysql session, create a new dummy db, then exit out, rebuild the pod, then see if that dummy db still exists. 

Now lets test this, first we install mysql client on our macbook:

```bash
brew install mysql-client
```



Now check if we can reach that port using nc or telnet:

```bash
$ minikube service svc-nodeport-mysql --url
http://192.168.99.106:31306



$ nc -v 192.168.99.106 31306
found 0 associations
found 1 connections:
     1: flags=82<CONNECTED,PREFERRED>
        outif vboxnet7
        src 192.168.99.1 port 56396
        dst 192.168.99.106 port 31306
        rank info not available
        TCP aux info available

Connection to 192.168.99.106 port 31306 [tcp/*] succeeded!
```

Now try establishing a mysql connection:

```bash
$ mysql -h 192.168.99.106 -P 31306 -u root -p'password123'
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

```

Now lets create a dummy db:

```bash
mysql> CREATE DATABASE dummy_db;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| dummy_db           |

| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> exit
Bye
```

Now let's rebuild our pod, and then see if our dummy db still exists:


```bash
$ mysql -h 192.168.99.106 -P 31306 -u root -p'password123'
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
